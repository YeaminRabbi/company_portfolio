		<h3 class="text-center">OUR APPROACH</h3>

		<p>
			We work with marginalised communities who hold deep insight into some of the world's most complex issues. The people we work with are ‘experts by experience,’ offering invaluable perspectives which can inform better services, government policy and public understanding. On Our Radar tackles the lack of agency, connectivity or resources that prevents them from sharing their knowledge and concerns.

			We specialise in using appropriate technology to develop solutions which bridge the communications gaps between unheard communities and influential audiences.

			Our services are diverse but have three things in common – those are driven by new ideas and innovation based on practicalities and lead to out-of-the-box insights. The tools and approaches we utilise are directly implementable. Thus, we empower individuals, organisations and networks to increase their positive social impact!

			We are guided by a strict ethical code, a willingness to challenge conventional thinking — evolving continuously how we work and how we look at marketplace challenges. Thus we can continue to deliver measurable, sustainable results for our clients and our communities.
